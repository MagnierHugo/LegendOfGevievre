# Legend of Gevievre

A 2D survivor-like game created for a Game Jam with the theme **"It's not a bug, it's a feature."**

What happens when standard game mechanics are intentionally broken? In Legend of Gevievre, every weapon and power-up is designed to misbehave in unique and challenging ways. Navigate procedurally generated maps, battle relentless monsters, and master the art of fighting with tools that refuse to work as intended.

## Key Features

- **Procedurally Generated Maps**: Every playthrough offers a fresh challenge with maps created using Wave Function Collapse algorithm
- **3 Distinct Monster Types**: Each enemy has unique AI behaviors that will test your survival skills
- **4 "Bugged" Weapons**: Each weapon comes with 3 upgrade tiers and refuses to work the way it should

## The "Features" (Weapon Mechanics)

Embrace the chaos! Each weapon in Legend of Gevievre has a mind of its own:

### 🗡️ The Sword
- **Should**: Rotate around the player for close-range defense
- **Does**: Picks a random enemy and orbits *them* instead
- *Good luck getting your sword back!*

### ⚔️ The Scythe
- **Should**: Double the XP you gain from defeated enemies
- **Does**: Completely stops all XP drops... but occasionally spawns rare "Big XP Bubbles" worth massive experience
- **Side Effect**: Picking up a Big XP Bubble causes you to lose control! Your character gets "kidnapped" and moves erratically for a short time
- *High risk, high reward—if you can handle the chaos*

### 🏹 The Bow
- **Should**: Shoot arrows in a straight line toward enemies
- **Does**: Arrows stutter and lag mid-flight, stopping repeatedly in mid-air before continuing
- *It's like fighting with a terrible internet connection*

### 💣 The Bomb
- **Should**: Explode on impact where it lands
- **Does**: Triggers the explosion at a completely random location on the map
- *Aim carefully... then pray*
